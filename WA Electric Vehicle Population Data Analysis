# For this project I downloaded data from [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajkumarpandey02/electric-vehicle-population-data/data)
# I explored the .csv data through Excel. 
# Then uploaded the .xlsx file into Microsoft SQL to explore using the following queries. 


-- 1. Let's check the entire database. 
SELECT * FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$;

-- 2. What is the population of electric vehicles registered with the Washington State Department of Liscensing. 
-- ANS: 135038
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT([VIN (1-10)]) FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$;

-- 3. Now, there are some electric vehicles registered with WA state, but the vehicle's owners might reside outside of the state. 
-- What is the population of electric vehicles that are potentially located in a different state? 
-- ANS. 312
SELECT COUNT(state) AS VehiclesInOtherStates	
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ WHERE state != 'WA'; 

-- 4. Now, I'm curious to know how many electric vehicles are potentialy residing in each state. 
-- ANS. WA = 134726, CA = 90, VA = 33, etc. 
SELECT state, COUNT(*) AS VEHICLECOUNT 
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	GROUP BY State 
	ORDER BY VEHICLECOUNT desc;

-- 5. What is the average electric range of this dataset's population? I have excluded range values being zero, under the assumption that this is missing data. 
-- ANS. 129.0475 
SELECT AVG([electric range]) AS AverageElectricRange 
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	WHERE [Electric Range] !=0;

-- 6. What is the average range by make? I have excluded range values being zero, assuming it is missing data. 
-- ANS. Tesla 240.4864, Jaguar 234, Polestar 233, Chevy 127.6198, etc. 
SELECT Make, Count(Make) AS Count, AVG([electric range]) AS AverageElectricRange
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	WHERE [Electric Range] !=0 GROUP BY Make
		ORDER BY AverageElectricRange desc;

-- 7. Previously, I had excluded range values that contained zero, assuming it wass missing data. How many vehicles were not accounted for in calculating average range? 
-- ANS. 56983
SELECT count([electric range]) AS amount_of_missing_range_values  
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	WHERE [Electric Range] = 0;

-- 8. What was the maximum electric range? What vehicle? 
-- ANS. 2020 Tesla Model S at 337.
SELECT TOP 1 [Model Year], Make, Model, MAX([electric range]) AS MAX_ElectricRange 
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	GROUP BY Make, model, [Model Year] 
	ORDER BY MAX([electric range]) DESC; 

-- 9. What was the minimum electric range? What vehicle? 
-- ANS. 2012 Toyota Pruis Plug-in at 6.
SELECT TOP 1 [Model Year], Make, Model, MIN([electric range]) AS MIN_ElectricRange 
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	WHERE [Electric Range] !=0 
	GROUP BY Make, model, [Model Year] 
	ORDER BY MIN([electric range]) ASC;

-- 10. Can you find the same min and max values, with a single query? 
-- ANS. Yes!
SELECT 
	MAX([electric range]) AS MAX_ElectricRange,
	MIN([electric range]) AS MIN_ElectricRange
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	WHERE [Electric Range] !=0 ;

-- 11. Let's explore the Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility column. Lets use three queries to determine how many of these electric vehicle's are CAFV eligible, not eligible, or unknown because battery range hasn't been researched.
-- ANS. 56983 Eligible, 16834 Not Eligible, 61221 Unknown Eligibility. 
SELECT count([VIN (1-10)]) AS CAFVeligible from dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ WHERE [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] LIKE '%Vehicle Eligible%';
SELECT count([VIN (1-10)]) AS NOTCAFVeligible from dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ WHERE [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] LIKE '%Not Eligible%';
SELECT count([VIN (1-10)]) AS unknownCAFVeligible from dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ WHERE [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] LIKE '%unknown%';

-- 12. Let's retry, and find the amounts for the three categories, with a single query.
-- ANS. 56983 Eligible, 16834 Not Eligible, 61221 Unknown Eligibility. Nice, queries match. 
SELECT [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility], COUNT(*) AS Amounts
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
		WHERE 
		[Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] LIKE '%Vehicle Eligible%'
		OR [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] LIKE '%Not Eligible%' 
		OR [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] LIKE '%unknown%'
	GROUP BY [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility]; 

-- 13. How many of these electric vehicle's are CAFV eligible, not eligible, or unknown by Model Year. 
-- ANS. # Eligible, # Not Eligible, # Unknown Eligibility.
SELECT [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility], Make
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
		WHERE 
		[Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] LIKE '%Vehicle Eligible%'
		OR [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] LIKE '%Not Eligible%' 
		OR [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] LIKE '%unknown%'
	GROUP BY Make, [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility]; 

-- 14. How many vehicles are Battery-Electric Vehicles (BEV) vs Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles?
-- ANS. 2 values
SELECT [Electric Vehicle Type], COUNT(*) AS BEV
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
		WHERE 
		[Electric Vehicle Type] LIKE '%BEV%'
		OR [Electric Vehicle Type] LIKE '%PHEV%' 
	GROUP BY [Electric Vehicle Type]; 

-- 15. What percent of vehicles are Battery-Electric Vehicles (BEV) vs Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles?
-- ANS. 2 values
SELECT [Electric Vehicle Type], ((COUNT(*)/COUNT([VIN (1-10)]))*100) AS PERCENT_BEV
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
		WHERE 
		[Electric Vehicle Type] LIKE '%BEV%'
		OR [Electric Vehicle Type] LIKE '%PHEV%' 
	GROUP BY [Electric Vehicle Type]; 

-- 16. What's the geographic distribution by county? 
SELECT county, COUNT(*) AS VEHICLECOUNT 
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	GROUP BY county 
	ORDER BY VEHICLECOUNT desc;

-- 17. What's the geographic distribution by zip-code? 
SELECT [postal code], COUNT(*) AS VEHICLECOUNT 
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	GROUP BY [Postal Count] 
	ORDER BY VEHICLECOUNT desc;

-- 18. How many electric vehicles by make? 
-- ANS. 
SELECT Make, Count(*) AS Count
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	GROUP BY Make
		ORDER BY Count(Make) desc;


-- 56983 out of the total 135038 (42%) of electric vehicles registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) are Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle Eligible.
