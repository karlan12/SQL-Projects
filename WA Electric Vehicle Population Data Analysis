# For this project I downloaded data from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajkumarpandey02/electric-vehicle-population-data/data)
# I explored the .csv data through Excel. 
# Then uploaded the .xlsx file into Microsoft SQL to explore using the following queries. 
# I completed this project with a visualization of this data in Tableau. Available at this link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/karla.n7563



-- 1. Let's check the entire database. 
SELECT * FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$;

-- 2. What is the population of electric vehicles registered with the Washington State Department of Licensing? 
-- ANS: 135038
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT([VIN (1-10)]) FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$;

-- 3. Now, there are some electric vehicles registered with WA state, but the vehicle's owners might reside outside of the state. 
-- What is the population of electric vehicles that are potentially located in a different state? 
-- ANS. 312
SELECT COUNT(state) AS VehiclesInOtherStates	
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ WHERE state != 'WA'; 

-- 4. Now, I'm curious to know how many electric vehicles are potentially residing in each state. 
-- ANS. WA = 134726, CA = 90, VA = 33, etc. 
SELECT state, COUNT(*) AS VEHICLECOUNT 
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	GROUP BY State 
	ORDER BY VEHICLECOUNT desc;

-- 5. What is the average electric range of this dataset's population? I have excluded range values being zero, under the assumption that this is missing data. 
-- ANS. 129.0475 [units]
SELECT AVG([electric range]) AS AverageElectricRange 
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	WHERE [Electric Range] !=0;

-- 6. What is the average range by make? I have excluded range values being zero, assuming it is missing data. 
-- ANS. Tesla 240.4864 [units], Jaguar 234 [units], Polestar 233 [units], Chevy 127.6198 [units], etc. 
SELECT Make, Count(Make) AS Count, AVG([electric range]) AS AverageElectricRange
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	WHERE [Electric Range] !=0 GROUP BY Make
		ORDER BY AverageElectricRange desc;

-- 7. Previously, I had excluded range values that contained zero, assuming it was missing data. How many vehicles were not accounted for in calculating average range? 
-- ANS. 56983 vehicles
SELECT count([electric range]) AS amount_of_missing_range_values  
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	WHERE [Electric Range] = 0;

-- 8. What was the maximum electric range? What vehicle? 
-- ANS. 2020 Tesla Model S at 337 [units].
SELECT TOP 1 [Model Year], Make, Model, MAX([electric range]) AS MAX_ElectricRange 
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	GROUP BY Make, model, [Model Year] 
	ORDER BY MAX([electric range]) DESC; 

-- 9. What was the minimum electric range? What vehicle? 
-- ANS. 2012 Toyota Pruis Plug-in at 6 [units].
SELECT TOP 1 [Model Year], Make, Model, MIN([electric range]) AS MIN_ElectricRange 
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	WHERE [Electric Range] !=0 
	GROUP BY Make, model, [Model Year] 
	ORDER BY MIN([electric range]) ASC;

-- 10. Can you find the same min and max values, with a single query? 
-- ANS. Yes!
SELECT 
	MAX([electric range]) AS MAX_ElectricRange,
	MIN([electric range]) AS MIN_ElectricRange
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	WHERE [Electric Range] !=0 ;

-- 11. Let's explore the Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility column. Lets use three queries to determine how many of these electric vehicle's are CAFV eligible, not eligible, or unknown because battery range hasn't been researched.
-- ANS. 56983 = Eligible, 16834 = Not Eligible, 61221 = Unknown Eligibility. 
SELECT count([VIN (1-10)]) AS CAFVeligible from dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ WHERE [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] LIKE '%Vehicle Eligible%';
SELECT count([VIN (1-10)]) AS NOTCAFVeligible from dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ WHERE [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] LIKE '%Not Eligible%';
SELECT count([VIN (1-10)]) AS unknownCAFVeligible from dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ WHERE [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] LIKE '%unknown%';

-- 12. Let's retry, and find the amounts for the three categories, with a single query.
-- ANS. 56983 = Eligible, 16834 = Not Eligible, 61221 = Unknown Eligibility. Nice, queries match. 
SELECT [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility], COUNT(*) AS VehicleCount
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
		WHERE 
		[Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] LIKE '%Vehicle Eligible%'
		OR [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] LIKE '%Not Eligible%' 
		OR [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] LIKE '%unknown%'
	GROUP BY [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility]; 

-- 13. How many of these electric vehicles are CAFV eligible, not eligible, or unknown by Model Year? 
-- ANS. Refer to Tableau.
SELECT [Model Year], [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility], count([Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility]) AS VehicleCount
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
		WHERE 
		[Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] LIKE '%Vehicle Eligible%'
		OR [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] LIKE '%Not Eligible%' 
		OR [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] LIKE '%unknown%'
	GROUP BY[Model Year], [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility]
	ORDER by [Model Year] desc, [Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility] desc; 

-- 14. How many vehicles are Battery-Electric Vehicles (BEV) vs Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles?
-- ANS. 31156 = PHEV and 103882 = BEV
SELECT [Electric Vehicle Type], COUNT(*) AS VehicleCount
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
		WHERE 
		[Electric Vehicle Type] LIKE '%BEV%'
		OR [Electric Vehicle Type] LIKE '%PHEV%' 
	GROUP BY [Electric Vehicle Type]; 

-- 15. What's the geographic distribution by county? 
-- ANS. 70842 vehicles in King, 152258 vehicles in Snohomish, 10410 vehicles in Pierce, etc. 
SELECT County, COUNT(*) AS VEHICLECOUNT 
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	GROUP BY County 
	ORDER BY VEHICLECOUNT desc;

-- 16. What's the geographic distribution by zip code? 
-- ANS. 3482 vehicles in 98052, 2382 vehicles in 98033, 2369 vehicles in 98012, etc. 
SELECT [Postal Code], COUNT(*) AS VEHICLECOUNT 
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	GROUP BY [Postal Code] 
	ORDER BY VEHICLECOUNT desc;

-- 17. How many electric vehicles by make? 
-- ANS. 61808 vehicles are Tesla, 13150 vehicles are Nissan, 11437 vehicles are Chevrolet etc. 
SELECT Make, Count(*) AS Count
	FROM dbo.Electric_Vehicle_Population_Dat$ 
	GROUP BY Make
		ORDER BY Count(Make) desc;

-- 56983 out of the total 135038 (42%) of electric vehicles registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) are Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle Eligible.
