### Overview
Welcome to my SQL Projects portfolio! This code repository contains SQL projects and problem-solving exercises that I have engaged with. The primary objective of this repository was to implement my foundational understanding of the SQL language and relational databases. By exploring this repository, you can come along on my journey towards learning the basics of SQL. If you have any questions, email karlav.negrete@gmail.com. Your curiosity is greatly appreciated! 

### Repository-Structure
Below, you'll find a brief overview of each of these projects and what they accomplished.
 
 1. [**Music Store Database & Analytics**](https://github.com/karlan12/SQL-Projects/blob/main/Music%20Store%20Database%20%26%20Analytics) -
I established my own store, specialized in a variety of musical instruments. To achieve this, I designed a table with at least 5 columns populated by least 15 items available in my musical store. Utilizing SELECT statements along with other query language, I was able to collect statistics about the inventory.

2. [**NFL Picks Analytics**](https://github.com/karlan12/SQL-Projects/blob/main/NFL%20Picks%20Analytics) - 
Using this 2015 [NFL draft picks](https://gist.github.com/pamelafox/3360f582f3309dd4c25b) database, I executed advanced SELECT queries to analyze the data and address various questions that might arise. This involved using aggregate functions such as average, MAX, MIN and taking advantage of filtering with HAVING, CASE, AND/OR functions.

 3. [**Famous Scientists Project & Analytics**](https://github.com/karlan12/SQL-Projects/blob/main/Famous%20Scientists%20Project%20%26%20Analytics) -
I constructed my own small database of "famous people," in particular, notable scientists. This database contains their names, countries of origin, and birth/ death years. Subsequently, I created another table to employ JOIN operations and produce readable lists, managinig information from both tables in a relational databse. My data was able to present information relating to each scientists' field of study and their contributions. This exercise demonstrates my understanding of JOIN functions and other query skills.
 
### Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to [Webucator](https://www.webucator.com/sql-training/course/introduction-sql-training-using-standard-sql/) for providing valuable SQL training. I would also like to extend my sincere appreciation to Khan Academy for offering an introduction to query language along with insightful practice problems.
